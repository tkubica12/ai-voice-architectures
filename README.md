# AI Voice architectures
This repository explores various AI voice chat architectures to demonstrate key tradoffs and design choices. On one side of the spectrum, we have text-based core AI agent that is universal for all modalities and channels and leverage standard speech-to-text and text-to-speech services. On the other side, we have a fully integrated voice agent model such gpt-4o-realtime. There are couple of intermediate architectures that are also explored. 

# Options

## Architecture "text core": Text-based Core AI Agent with Standard STT and TTS

## Architecture "E2E voice": End-to-End Voice Agent with gpt-4o-realtime
